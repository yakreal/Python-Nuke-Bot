# Python Nuke Bot
Hey everyone,

This is a Simple Nuke Bot made in Python which will add a lot of channels and send some message in these channels.
You can specify the channel's name, message sended to these channels, bot activity text, bot prefix in <b1>config.ini</b1>
Also, dont forget to add the bot's token in the .ini file.

If you want to start the bot type <b1>!start</b1>, but it depends on prefix that you've set, in my case it's '!'.
