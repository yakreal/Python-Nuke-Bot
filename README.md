# Python Nuke Bot
Hey everyone,

This is a Simple Nuke Bot made in Python which will add a lot of channels and send some message in these channels.
You can specify the channel's name, message sended to these channels, bot activity text, bot prefix in config.ini.
Also, dont forget to add the bot's token in the .ini file.

If you want to start the bot type "!start", but it depends on prefix that you've set in configuration file. In my case it's '!'.

Enjoy.
